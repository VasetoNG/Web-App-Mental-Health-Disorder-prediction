# Web-App-Mental-Health-Disorder-prediction

## Project description
Mental health disorders (MHD) are spread everywhere. Nearly 800 million people live with an MHD. It is therefore not surprising that MHDs are essential axes of global health. We have created a model that targets the recognition of mental health disorders. The model is based on a survey dataset that measures attitudes toward mental health and the frequency of mental health disorders in the workplace. We implemented our model in this web application to help assess the risk of whether an individual currently has MHD or not.
